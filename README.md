Use sklearn module, especially LogisticRegression. 

Perceptron model is good but amount of data is too small to maximize output.

Initially I use GridSearchCV module to find best parameter but I finally realize simple is best.

So I only use LogisticRegression and touch parameter C, max_iter.

When regulatory strength is 1000, model show best output. 

I choose max_iter as 1000 beacause 100 is too small to raise accuracy and 10000 spends too much time.

thank you.
